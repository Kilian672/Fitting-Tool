# Fitting-Tool
This project was initiated by Prof. Dr. Konstantinos Panagiotou to develop a program to compare a model based on differential equations with real data. The model can be created with the help of a website, which was also created by the professor's collaborators. This website can also be used to generate artificial data to test the program.
